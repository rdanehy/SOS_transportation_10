We envision our initial product of Take a Seat being a launch point into various other customer related improvements to software and hardware as the Indiana economy recovers and stabilizes in the coming years. Take a Seat has a vision of creating a healthier transportation climate within IndyGo through technology implementation to inform riders on the seating arrangements of a given bus. This technology empowers riders to make decisions about bus rides in relation to their own individual health as well as the health of others. Take a Seatâ€™s market offering can affect transportation beyond the Coronavirus, and seeks to make big changes within the transportation sector affecting how consumers engage in transportation services forever.

							<p style=" font-size: 22pt; line-height: 2.0; text-align: left; margin-left: 3.0cm; margin-right:3cm;"> <br><br> Currently, cities are designed and operating in a manner which incentives individual mobility. This has resulted in infrastructure systems likening smaller cars like sedans to larger vehicles like buses, resulting in a variety of tiresome challenges that drivers encounter on the road. In the current climate of increasing populations and global warming awareness, we believe it is becoming not only necessary, but vital that cities redesign their transportation arrangements into a more intelligent, green, and efficient model. We hope that our current product will serve as a stepping stool to allow us to gain recognition and trust with our customer base so that we can face these new transportation challenges together.

One component of this technology is called vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), which allows vehicles to communicate with one another. Another component is vehicle to infrastructure (V2I), which allows vehicles to communicate with external systems such as street lights, buildings, and even cyclists or pedestrians.  V2X systems can convey important information to the driver regarding inclement weather, nearby accidents, road conditions, and the dangerous activities of nearby vehicles. The benefits of these systems are innumerable, with the most obvious benefits being improved safety and efficiency. These systems can even be extended and integrated in a way in which parking, tolls, and other fees are automatic payments.These technologies sound incredibly bold, but there are real world examples in which these are being used. For example, both Utah and Georgia Departments of Transportation have already implemented similar technologies. We view the SoftStat product as the starting point and a completely integrated V2X system as the endpoint. We believe the technology has already arrived, and we strongly believe Take A Seat has technical skills to fulfill the dream of a fully implemented V2X System.
